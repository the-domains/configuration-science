Developing a solution that is sensitive to the needs of organisations concerned with mental health care _**Configuration Science**_ specialises in _inter_ and _intra_ communication enablement for multi-disciplinary teams where confidentiality is paramount.

Clients only ever discuss their private issues with the strict understanding that what they convey by their words remains theirs.

We are creating the means by which mutually beneficial exchanges between professionals is facilitated.

These exchanges embrace collaborative working, publishing and annotation within various scopes and messaging.

This includes unobtrusive but fine grained access control forward and backward (retractable) rights over exchanges and various means of evaluation the invitation of fellow participants in user scoped meeting exchanges.

The solution, based on research in various associated areas as offered by Configuration Science, will be further detailed as each functional artifact becomes available.
